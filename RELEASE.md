## Release utility

### Usage

This utility is built around release branches and tags.

Release branches have specific format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (i.e 0.2.3).

Release tags have specific format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (i.e. v0.2.2).

#### Init

To initialize a new release, go to the standard branch.

```
git checkout master
```

Use the `init` subcommand with a version number.

```
release init 1.0.0
```

For example, a new tag will be created called `v1.0.0`.
